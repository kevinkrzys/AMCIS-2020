# [On-Demand Intelligent Resource Assessment and Allocation System Using NLP for Project Management](https://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2020/it_project_mgmt/it_project_mgmt/8/)

### Abstract:

In the current dynamic era of Agile projects and the usage of different methodologies for managing projects, the assessment, allocation/reallocation of skilled resources still remains a challenge. This could be worse in projects with tight deadlines and cost restrictions. The current project management tools may help in managing projects, calculating buffers, costs, and giving out deadlines but the major fallout of these tools is the inability to identify the appropriate resources needed for a given situation. Our Resource Assessment and Allocation System directly tackles these pain points of the existing systems by assessing resources based on various factors and recommends candidates that would be a good fit. The system will consider the various project and resource parameters like cost and finish date and resource parameters like cost, allocation term, grooming period, multifunctionality, and experience. It will then recommend prospective candidates who could be allocated to projects.
